# vscode-builder
Docker container and associated scripts to build a vscode-oss DEB and RPM from source. It took me a bit of debugging to get this built, so I figure it's worth putting up as a starting point for anyone else struggling with the builds. 

## Prerequisites
* Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 16.10, but should work on any version of Linux that supports Docker)
* Docker (installed)

## Directions

```
git clone 
cd vscode-builder
./build.sh
```
When script finishes, a `.deb` installer will appear in `./out/`. The latest tag is always used to build the package.

## Notes

* Uncomment "Build RPM" section in run.sh to build a .rpm
* Uncomment the last line to keep container alive after build finishes
* The resulting installer has support for the extension gallery (ability to install extensions directly from the vscode UI). Comment the ```Add extension gallery support``` section to disable.
* Currently, the resulting `.deb` and `.rpm` files will be owned by root
